# Student Database Desktop App

I built a desktop app using PyQt6 which stores the name, subject and phone number of students.

User can add, delete, edit, and search the database.

The app contains toolbars, status bar, menus and sub menus and has two versions. One connected to SQLite3 and other connected to MySQL.

To practice PyQt6 I created an Age Calculator and Speed Calculator Apps as well.
